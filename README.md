## 2. Usage

### 2.1 Livewire component

The package provides a Livewire component that you can use everywhere in your Laravel project - e.g. within modals, forms or landing pages.

#### 2.1.1 Sample

Add the component into your blade views like usual. 

```php
<div class="bg-gray-100">
  @livewire('tall-multiselect-cards', ['identifier' => 'User'])
</div>
```

Please take note that you'll need to determine which configuration the component should use by adding the necessary identifier parameter.

### 2.2 Emitted event

The component emits an event when a user clicks the `Save` button which allows you to interact with the component.

The emitted event name will be suffixed by the chosen `identifier` (see [Configuration values](#41-configuration-values) - [1]) to use the component multiple times (and perhaps at the same page).
It contains an array of the model IDs (value of the model attribute that you've configured to use as `uniqueId` attribute) that were selected by checking the cards.

#### 2.2.1 Sample event / implementation

* Event name: `tall-multiselect-cards-User`
* Event data: `[2, 4, 42]`

Note: When no cards are selected, the event will be emitted and contains an empty array.

Other components need to listen to the event and call a method to process it further.
When you're not familiar with event listening in Livewire, please take a look at the [offical Livewire documentation](https://laravel-livewire.com/docs/2.x/events#event-listeners).

Sample: Refactoring a Livewire component that accepted and processed form input using `wire:model="state.users"` before.

```php
class AwesomeForm extends Component
{
    public $state = [];
 
    protected $listeners = ['tall-multiselect-cards-User' => 'addSelectedUsers'];
 
    public function addSelectedUsers($value)
    {
        // Do whatever you want... validation, processing, etc...
        $this->state['users'] = $value;
    }
}
```

## 3. Installation

            'secondary_button_color_border' => 'gray-600', // [4.5]
            'secondary_button_color_border_hover' => 'gray-400', // [4.5]
            'secondary_button_color_border_focus' => 'gray-400', // [4.5]
            'secondary_button_color_text' => 'gray-900', // [4.5]
            'secondary_button_color_text_hover' => 'gray-400', // [4.5]
            'secondary_button_color_text_focus' => 'gray-400', // [4.5]
        ]
    ],
```
* [1] Identifier: Provide a string that identifies the specific configuration / component. Note that this value should only contain [alpha_dash](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/validation#rule-alpha-dash) chars.
* [2] `model`: FQCN of the model class that you want to use with the component.
* [3] `modelAttributes`: Model attributes that you want to display as card content. 
  * Important: `uniqueId` won't be shown as card content and need to be set to the attribute that contains the model ID (or UUID). That's usually the `id` column in your database. 
* [4] `settings`: Array of settings for the component.
  * [4.1] `paginate_data`: Enable or disable pagintion. 
    * Enabled: The component loads only the configured number ([4.2]) of models from the database. A "Load more ..." link will be shown to add the configured number ([4.2]) of models until all models are loaded.
    * Disabled: The component loads all models from the database at once.
  * [4.2] `paginate_data_per_page`: The amount of cards
    * that will be loaded initially and
    * that will be added when loading more models.
  * [4.3] `enable_optional_brackets`: Enable or disable brackets for the `optional` card position. You should disable this option when you set `attributes.optional` to NULL.
    * Enabled: The `optional` attribute value will be displayed within brackets.
    * Disabled: The `optional` attribute value will be displayed without brackets.
  * [4.4] `hide_search`: Enable or disable search input.
  * [4.5] `*_color_*`: Feel free to edit the color schema of the component. The configuration items were chosen self-explanatory to ensure easy styling. You can use every color that's provided by [TailwindCSS color palette](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors).

**All config values are required and need to return a string unless otherwise stated.**

## 5. Macros

The available macros allow you to manipulate the retrieved data. Just add them to the `boot` method of your applications ServiceProvider. (e.g. 'AppServiceProvider').

### 5.1 query

To extend / override the database query that loads the initial data, implement the `query` macro.

Sample:

```php
TallMultiselectCards::macro('query', function ($model, $selectedAttributes)
{
    return $model::select($selectedAttributes)->where('is_suspended', false);
});
```

### 5.2 filter

Implement the `filter` macro if you want to manipulate the collection returned by the database query.

```php
TallMultiselectCards::macro('filter', function ($collection)
{
    $filtered = $collection->filter(function ($item) {
        if (!$item->is_expired) {
            return $item;
        }
    });

    return $filtered;
});
```
**Note:** You should not manipulate the structure of the items themselves, as the collection will be processed further. Use the package without pagination, if you'll add/remove items from the collection at this point to avoid unexpected pagination results.

## 6. Tests

Please install the dev-dependencies first. Then you'll be able to run the tests via composer:

* Testing with testbench binary: `composer test`
* Testing with PHPUnit binary: `composer test-p`
